Created a class to help with assigning commands to driver and operator controllers. 

1. When using this, there will be an error if the code tries to assign more than one command to a button. This has happened in the past and caused problems.
2. With one method call, a tab on the dashboard will be created that summarizes what buttons are assigned to what commands and what buttons are unused. Currently a separate document is maintained manually showing this. This automates that process.
